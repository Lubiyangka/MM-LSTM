# Momentum Modeling in Tennis Matches via MM-LSTM

## Introduction  

This paper proposes an innovative **Momentum-LSTM (MM-LSTM)** model to capture the unobservable "momentum" phenomenon in tennis matches, systematically addressing its existence verification, dynamic prediction, and cross-domain applications. Through multidimensional data modeling and interpretability analysis, we reveal the critical mechanistic role of momentum in match progression, providing new perspectives for competitive sports science.

## Methodology and Results  

### Dynamic Modeling and Validation  

The **MM-LSTM architecture** leverages LSTM gating mechanisms to dynamically characterize match state evolution through the following components:  

- **Cell State** continuously tracks real-time player status  
- **Forget Gate** modulates historical state memory intensity  
- **Output Gate** maps immediate tactical decisions

**Spearman correlation analysis** is employed for key feature selection, enabling data dimensionality reduction and noise filtering.  

### Dual-Model Comparative Validation  

By constructing a **stochastic probability model** as baseline, we forward-derive non-momentum factors and reverse-engineer MM-LSTM's momentum representation logic. Experiments demonstrate MM-LSTM's **94.52% prediction accuracy** on test sets significantly outperforms the baseline model (68.23%), statistically validating momentum existence.

### Deep Interpretability Analysis  

**Function gradient importance analysis** reveals nonlinear coupling between score difference gradients and momentum variations. We establish a probability transition model to quantify momentum propagation effects, proposing **5 tactical optimization strategies** encompassing psychological regulation and critical-point management.

## Key Contributions  

**Theoretical Innovation**: First coupling framework integrating LSTM gating mechanisms with momentum dynamics, overcoming traditional statistical models' limitations in latent state representation.  
**Methodological Breakthrough**: Dual evidence-chain construction through bidirectional modeling (forward probabilistic derivation + reverse gradient interpretation) strengthens momentum existence verification.  
**Practical Value**: Achieves **90.71% generalization accuracy** on unseen matches, with extensibility to environmental/psychological factors for real-time tactical decisions.  
**Cross-Domain Insights**: Table tennis migration experiments (2024 WTT data) reveal data scale and state representation completeness as critical performance factors, guiding multi-sport analytical optimization.

- Empowers athletes to identify **momentum tipping points** for critical-point mastery  
- Promotes **integrated analysis platforms** combining biomechanics and psychology  

Research outcomes are transformed into operational guidelines through memoranda, driving data-driven training paradigm innovation. Validation on table tennis data confirms the framework's migration potential in racket sports, establishing foundations for cross-sport studies.
